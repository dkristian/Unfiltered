Improvements

* Add `headerNames` iterator to HttpRequest, [issue 116][116]

Fixes

* Netty MultiPart.splitContentTypeHeader fails for non-parameterised content type values, [issue 154][154]
* In the unfiltered-oauth module, some valid OAuth1 signatures were
  rejected when using query-string or POST parameters rather than
  OAuth headers. The `OAuth.Header` extractor now performs its own
  percent-decoding, and the `Sinatures.verify` assumes the given
  `params` map has already been decoded.
  
This version of Unfiltered is published for Scala 2.9.1-1 thorugh 2.10.x.
