### Directives

This release includes [teigen][tg]'s **Directives** library as a
standard Unfiltered module. With this module it's much easier to
respond appropriately to requests that do not meet a service's
acceptance criteria.

For example, when a particular header is required to handle a request,
a simple Unfiltered application might require it through
pattern-matching. When that header is not present, the relevant case
doesn't match and the service would respond with a 404 status. It's
much better to respond with a specific error status, and Directives
makes this easy.

Check out the examples in the [Directives README][read].
